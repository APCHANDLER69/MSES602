# Week 6 - Amazon Web Service (AWS) Cloud Evaluation
**Provide an evaluation of the Cloud Track for this class (specially the AWS training). What did you like? What did you not like? Should the Cloud Track be used for future classes?**
### ***What did you like?***
There are many things that I liked about the AWS training.  One thing for certain is that each module contained a great deal of information and was detailed.  Usually, I would have a hard time completing even one video in one sitting, but the subject content, for the most part, kept my attention.
<br><br>
At first glance, seeing that it was ten (10) modules, my reaction was like, this was not going to be too bad.  Once I got into the modules, I found that they were going to be time consuming.  Even with the modules being kind of long, I think they way they segmented the modules were great.  The didnâ€™t make each section, within each module, to long.  Designing the course like that definitely address the compacity that a person is able to pay attention.
<br><br>
Because I am more of a visual learner, the training contained great visual aide.  I was able to pause the videos and review the diagrams to follow allowing.
<br><br>
I found that the presenters reflected back to previous material, to support the new material they were covering.
<br><br>
Because of the exponential growth of AWS, the material is great for those DevOps professionals who want to learn something new for personal use or to transition to a new role.  I would say for beginners, the modules should be done at a slower pace, and do other research in-between some of the material.
<br>
### ***What did you not like?***
For me, it took time to relate to much of the material due to the lack of prior experience or knowledge needed to embrace the information and find it helpful or even useful.  Because of that, it would be unfair for me to try and come up with things I did not like, since I think the overall presentation was done well.
<br>
### ***Should the Cloud Track be used for future classes?***
_Oh definitely!_ AWS is not just a powerhouse cloud service; they are also setting standards for other providers to follow.  I am not sure what is in the other courses in Regis, but I think AWS should be a course within itself, because it will still cover much of the technology that has led up to the success of AWS.
