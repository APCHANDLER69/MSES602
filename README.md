## First Time using Github Markdown so I want to do some testing

<!--How to hide a comment-->
Some of the markdown is similar to HTML scripting. I like HTML better.  With Mark down you have to have the words right after and before the symbols, or they will not work, but you do get to see what it will look like before you preview.
<br>
**Testing Bold 1**
<br>
__Testing Bold 2__
<br>
<b>Here I use HTML to bold </b>
<br>
*Testing Italic 1*
<br>
*Testing Italic 2*
<br>
_Test Italic 3_
<br>
<i> Here I use HTML for italic</i>
~Strike Through~
<br>
***Bold and Italic***
<br>
Here we have example of <sub>Subscript</sub>
<br>
Here we have example of <sup>Superscript</sup>
<br>
>Markdown quote block
<blockquote>HTML block quote</blockquote>
<br>
To do an order list use one of the symbols below and a space between the item. It seem like you need to leave a line space to get it to work.
<br>

- order 1
  - order 2
* order 3
* order 4
+ order 5
+ order 6
1. order 7
1. order 8
<br>
Below I used HTML for order list.
<ul>
  <li>list 1</li>
  <li>list 2</li>
</ul>
<br>
Table test 1
<br>
<table>
  <caption>Table Test 1</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>header 1</th>
    <th>header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>detail 1</td>
    <td>detail 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

Table Test 2
<br>
<table>
  <caption style="text-align:right">Table Test 2</caption>
  <tr>
    <th></th>  
    <th>header 1</th>
    <th>header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Row 1</th>
    <td>detail 1</td>
    <td>detail 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

How to make table with markdown.

| Rank | THING-TO-RANK |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1|               |
|     2|               |
|     3|               |

<br>
seems like I have to have a gap before the next header.

<details>
<summary>Example of Collapse List</summary>

| Rank | Column 2 |

|     1| Row 1|
